/**
 * A system of particles with similar behavior.
 *
 * Particle systems define particle behavior through "modules", of which there are multiple kinds:
 *
 * * [updateModules] are called in every tick for each particle. They are called in sequence for each particle, meaning
 * any state set in one can be safely used in the next.
 * * [globalUpdateModules] are called every tick and passed the full list of particles. They are generally used for depth
 * sorting (see [DepthSortModule]) however they are useful for anything that requires the full particle list in one call.
 * * [renderPrepModules] are similar to [updateModules] but are called before each particle is rendered. They can be
 * used to initialize [VariableBinding]s so a complex computation does not have to be repeated in several of the render
 * module's input bindings.
 * * [renderModules] are in charge of actually rendering the particles into the world. You can add multiple and each
 * will render in order.
 *
 * The various module lists may be safely modified as long as the system isn't currently ticking or rendering, however
 * once any particles have been created it is no longer safe to create new bindings with [bind].
 *
 * When creating particle systems it is highly recommended to spawn enough to cause a moderate amount of lag and run
 * sampling to find which hotspots are slowing down the game. It is often surprising what small things have a large
 * impact.
 *
 * After creating a particle system, add it to the [ParticleSystemManager].
